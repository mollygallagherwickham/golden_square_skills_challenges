# 1. Describe the Problem
Put or write the user story here. Add any clarifying notes you might have.


# 2. Design the Class System
Consider diagramming out the classes and their relationships. Take care to focus on the details you see as important, not everything. The diagram below uses asciiflow.com but you could also use excalidraw.com, draw.io, or miro.com

Also design the interface of each class in more detail. (classes and methods with what they do and expect to return)


# 3. Create Examples as Integration Tests
Create examples of the classes being used together in different situations and combinations that reflect the ways in which the system will be used.


# 4. Create Examples as Unit Tests
Create examples, where appropriate, of the behaviour of each relevant class at a more granular level of detail.

Encode each example as a test. You can add to the above list as you go.


# 5. Implement the Behaviour
After each test you write, follow the test-driving process of red, green, refactor to implement the behaviour.
